			<p>This is our mission. It includes flashy text about who we are and what we do, and how we're super idealistic and really just want to change the beautiful but faulted world of dance. It's super inspirational.</p>

			<p>we produce events (mostly CRAWLs, but sometimes films) that offer opportunity + production support to artists</p>

		<div class="activity" id="design">
			<h1>design</h1>
			<p>and we offer web design/dev and branding services to artists and artsy businesses because we're nerdy, and also we think dance has an image problem and we want people to be able to keep up with other activities that might have better websites.</p>

		<h2></ cl!ck > World Premiere</h2>
		<p>A multimedia installation showing that our personalities and cultural tendencies lie within our clicks, likes, follows, views, swipes, and profiles. It's dance, code, and electronic music inspired the intricate ways that we curate our online selves. It's narcissistic. It's goofy. It's self aware. It's sad, because it points out that our own self-indulgent, attention whoring perpetuates harmful stereotypes, allows people to use our data to profile us around those stereotypes. Our clicks and keep us eternally wrapped up in our own bullshit.</p>
